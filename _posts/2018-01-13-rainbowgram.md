<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic">The first AI music thing I've heard that I'd consider adding to a playlist.</p>

I'm used to checking in on ['AI](https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6577761/Google_-_Magenta_music_sample.0.mp3) [music'](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/ai/ai-duet) and feeling like, I wouldn't actually want to listen to this. The field is in its early days.

I wasn't sure about "Rainbowgram" at first either (felt too low-res and noisy for my tastes)[^on-second-thought], but then **it shifted about 32 seconds in** into something I could imagine being played during festival season by artists like [Bleep Bloop](https://open.spotify.com/track/0w5mCocqrW6MGI4Sq93JfO) & [Space Jesus](https://open.spotify.com/track/4YTrP8N3DU7zYyAR1OJ5h3).

Huang created "Rainbowgram" using Magenta's [NSynth](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/nsynth) experiment. He is an experimental musician and YouTuber out of Toronto - here's his video explainer on ["ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MUSIC"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaALLWQmCdI):

Huang still needed to select and arrange the hundreds of AI-generated music segments he used to create the piece. I appreciate the human element still needed in music compositions like this, the collaboration between human and machine.

#### Footnotes

[^on-second-thought]: After a few more plays, I learned to appreciate even the first 31 seconds of "Rainbowgram" as perhaps Huang's ode to the raw-er AI soundbites that he selected from, arranged, and stacked.
