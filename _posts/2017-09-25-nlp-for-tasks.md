_Everything between this sentence and the [Wrap Up](/portfolio-building/2017/09/25/nlp-for-tasks.html#wrap-up) section has been converted from my [nlp_classifier](https://github.com/iconix/nlp-sandbox/blob/master/nlp_classifier.ipynb) notebook[^nbconvert] on GitHub._

# Wrap Up

Another way to describe this notebook: as both **1)** generalizing (by devaluing specific word choice) _bag-of-words_ using part-of-speech, and **2)** enhancing n-gram (bigram) selection using _syntactic dependencies_.

#### Towards functional over topical similarity for task classification

[_Dependency-Based Word Embeddings_](https://levyomer.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/dependency-based-word-embeddings-acl-2014.pptx) by Omer Levy & Yoav Goldberg is a presentation I discovered after writing this notebook. The following hints at why the methodology in this notebook works:
>- Bag-of-words contexts induce topical similarities
>- Dependency contexts induce functional similarities
>    - Share the same semantic type
>    - [Co-hyponyms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyponymy_and_hypernymy#Co-hyponyms)

This duo also provided [dependency-based embeddings from English Wikipedia](https://levyomer.wordpress.com/2014/04/25/dependency-based-word-embeddings/), which is awesome - one cool extension I'd like to pursue is comparing my very manually-engineered classifiers against a classifier with these pre-trained embeddings at its core.

#### Demo Fridays: Redux

This notebook was used as part of my second [team-wide demo](/career/2017/09/01/demo-fridays.html) - so here's to pushing myself!
