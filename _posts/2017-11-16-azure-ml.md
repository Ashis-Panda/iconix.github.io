After bootstrapping a dead-simple language model for [task extraction](/career/2017/07/14/ai-at-work.html) using Microsoft [LUIS](/career/2017/08/14/luis.html) (Language Understanding Intelligent Service)[^luis-model], then building a prototype task service and [OneNote add-in](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/quickstarts/onenote-quickstart) around it, I wanted to extend the model significantly. My use of LUIS did not really fit into its prescribed "utterances&mdash;entities&mdash;intents" taxonomy; further, LUIS is not extensible enough for the kind of custom language modeling I wanted to do.

Enter: [Azure Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/overview-what-is-azure-ml). Azure ML is a newly-revamped[^naming] suite of machine learning services and tools. It includes a _Workbench_ for data preparation and model development using Python and family (Anaconda, Jupyter, scikit-learn, spaCy... whatever you need); an _Experimentation_ service for running experiments, locally or remotely, on your local machine or Docker or Spark; and a _Model Management_ service for deploying models behind a web service.

So after iterating on an NLP model for task classification ([read all about it here](/portfolio-building/2017/09/25/nlp-for-tasks.html)), I turned to Azure ML to deploy it so that I could swap out the API call to LUIS with an API call to this new service hosting my custom NLP model[^disclaimer].

Azure ML is still in preview, and so there were various hiccups in getting my model deployed[^issues]. However, the team was very responsive to my questions and bug reports, and I eventually got things up and running. Because of this active engagement, I'm confident stability will continue to improve during preview.

### Prebuilt vs Custom ML

My experience with using both LUIS and Azure ML has illustrated to me the importance of having both prebuilt/API-like _and_ custom ML solutions available for developer use. LUIS as a prebuilt solution was excellent for **bootstrapping** my idea and getting _something_ off the ground. Once I felt more comfortable in the space and had the context to apply more **domain-specific** ideas, I could easily transition to Azure ML, spaCy, scikit-learn, etc. to implement them.

#### Footnotes

[^luis-model]: How dead-simple? LUIS essentially held a classification model with a single feature: "does this candidate phrase contain a verb in the given list of present-tense verbs?" If it does, the phrase is a task.

[^naming]: Keeping to Microsoft tradition, naming around Azure's machine learning offerings is confusing. Back in 2014, Microsoft had a thing called Azure Machine Learning - that thing is now called [Azure Machine Learning _Studio_](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning-studio/), and the new thing launched this year became Azure Machine Learning.

[^disclaimer]: Quick disclaimer: I work at Microsoft so I'm more inclined to check out Microsoft products, but I don't work on Azure or anything else too related. These are just my views and experience.

[^issues]: Most issues occurred around deployment/operationalization. Something that worked yesterday would, occasionally enough, not work the following day. It's somewhat understandable though: the system is essentially in beta, clearly has lots of dependencies, and the codebase seems to still be under churn. My biggest issue came from a hidden subscription cap on `microsoft.insights/CurrentBillingFeatures/Basic` that caused Azure provisioning to fail (which I think, after my complaining to the team, eventually got [documented](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/how-to-deploy-troubleshooting-guide)).
