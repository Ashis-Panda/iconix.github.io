Well, I've been a bit on-again, off-again about setting up this blog since [my first post on May 7](/blogging/2017/05/07/hello-world.html), but I think this is finally a space I have made my own and can be proud of! Shout out to the [{ Personal } Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/PanosSakkos/personal-jekyll-theme) creators and contributors for giving me such a strong base to start with.

Now, on to real content!

I want to share my personal notes from taking and completing Coursera's _Machine Learning_ course from Andrew Ng in 2014. This class is very technical and comprehensive, and it is always one of the first MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) mentioned to anyone interested in learning more about ML.

I'm an avid note-taker - which is part of why working for OneNote has been such a great fit for me - and I was particularly meticulous about these notes. BTW: Taking these notes with mathematical equations in OneNote was _sooo_ much more enjoyable than it was to take _Applied Matrix Theory_ notes in Google Docs in college. I really wish I had known about OneNote back then...
