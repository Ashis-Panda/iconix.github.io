Through a series of Microsoft happenings, I ended up finding and listening to a really insightful [Hanselminutes podcast episode](https://hanselminutes.com/580/machine-learning-deep-learning-and-artificial-intelligence-with-edaena-salinas-jasso) with guest Edaena Salinas Jasso. She made the shift from web development to machine learning/AI work with Microsoft Research. In talking about her path, she mentioned a couple resources that she highly recommends: fast.ai's [Practical Deep Learning For Coders, Part 1](http://course.fast.ai/) and Udacity's [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120) (course description: "Pattern Recognition for Fun and Profit" [^pattern]).

Both courses come off as hands-on and particularly accessible to anyone with a coding background, so I plan on checking them out soon (and ditching an internal Microsoft Research course series on AI that is a little too _research-y_). But in visiting the fast.ai site, I found a blog post Q&A entitled, ["Alternatives to a Degree to Prove Yourself in Deep Learning"](http://www.fast.ai/2017/04/06/alternatives/) by Rachel Thomas. I really just want to re-blog the entire post here, but I doubt that's good blog etiquette... so go read it in full over there.

I'll just say that there's an entire section on _Why you (yes, you) should blog_, and Rachel's points remind me of [The Social Developer](/blogging/2017/05/07/hello-world.html#the-social-developer) idea (okay, I'm going to reproduce a small part of the post now).

> Here are some reasons to blog:
>
> - It’s like a resume, only better. I know of a few people who have had blog posts lead to job offers!
> - Helps you learn. Organizing knowledge always helps me synthesize my own ideas. One of the tests of whether you understand something is whether you can explain it to someone else. A blog post is a great way to do that.
> - I’ve gotten invitations to conferences and invitations to speak from my blog posts. I was invited to the TensorFlow Dev Summit (which was awesome!) for writing a blog post about how I don’t like TensorFlow.
> - Meet new people. I’ve met several people who have responded to blog posts I wrote.
> - Saves time. Any time you answer a question multiple times through email, you should turn it into a blog post, which makes it easier for you to share the next time someone asks.

Just a little more validation about this new venture :slightly_smiling_face: I also need the occasional, friendly reminder to avoid perfectionism.
