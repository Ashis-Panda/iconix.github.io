James McCaffrey is the guy running the deep learning course for Microsoft employees that I deemed ["too _research-y_"](/blogging/2017/07/09/fast-ai-blog) a couple of months ago... at the time, I craved a more hands-on approach to deep learning aimed at newbies. Now that I'm [further along](/notes/2017/08/18/fast-week2) with fast.ai's more practical approach, I'd like to give his version another try.

I like his blog because it's very conversational and straightforward, much like the way he talks during his course. For example, in a [recent interview](https://jamesmccaffrey.wordpress.com/2017/08/11/i-do-an-interview-about-machine-learning-on-microsofts-channel-9/) his straight-talking ability is on full display as he defines and differentiates buzzwords like _data science_, _machine learning_, and _artificial intelligence_. I also like that his posts are so casual yet informative &mdash; it reads like he simply jots down whatever interesting comes to mind on any given day, despite him being a Serious Researcher. This approach probably explains how he's able to post so frequently.

James reminds me to keep it loose myself. I also lowkey like how old school his Wordpress template is: a little plain maybe but highly functional.
