## About

I am a software engineer who likes to code for the web. I took leave from Microsoft <span id="a-onenote">[OneNote](https://www.onenote.com/)</span> so that I can study deep learning full time as an [OpenAI Scholar](/dl/2018/05/30/openai-scholar). I blog here (mainly) as I dabble with data, NLP, and machine learning.

Catch me at your local music festival, otherwise. Or on a field nearby playing flag football.
