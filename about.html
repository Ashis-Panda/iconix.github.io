## About

I am a software developer and aspiring data scientist. I currently work at Microsoft <span id="a-onenote">[OneNote](https://www.onenote.com/)</span>, and I like to code for the web. I blog here (mainly) as I mess with data and <a href="/blogging/2017/05/07/hello-world">build up a portfolio</a>.

Catch me at your local music festival, otherwise. Or on a field nearby playing flag football.
