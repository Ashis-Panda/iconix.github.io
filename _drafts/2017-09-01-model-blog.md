He's the guy who's running the internal deep learning course that I deemed too research-y... but maybe after I have fast.ai further under my belt, I'll give his version another quick whirl.

I like his blog because it's very conversational and straightforward, much like the way he talks. His definitions of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence are a great example. I also like that his posts are so casual yet informative- it reads like whatever interesting comes to mind that he feels like jotting down in many cases, despite him being a msr og. Reminds me to keep it loose myself. Also I kinda like how old-school wordpress it looks. A little creaky, but highly functional.

He also blogs very frequently, which is likely a product of his casual approach to it.
