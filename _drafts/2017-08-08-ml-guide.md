TODO: A Beginner's Guide to Machine Learning, 5 Questions of Data Science, create that flow chart (mermaid)?, _The Master Algorithm_ definitions, holehouse/ng notes, reinforcement learning section, active learning (+LUIS)...

I think I'm trying to run PCA on the field of machine learning... what are the principal components of ML? How can I reduce and differentiate all the jargon? By the 5 qs? By the 5 tribes?

Additionally, what's ML relationship to AI and data science? Now that I've confirmed deep learning is a subset of ML

    - "There's no fixed definition of these things"
    - Data science: "traditional statistical techniques, and then using human intuition to make predictions"
    - Machine learning: "using data to make predictions"
        - Predictive analytics/business intelligence: "can be a subset of the machine learning; a problem domain with the implication of a direct connection to increased revenue or decreased cost or something like this"
    - Artificial intelligence: "using very advanced machine learning techniques to mimic human behavior"
    - "bigger data; smarter algorithms; and increased processing via gpus, on demand in the cloud"

-- strengths and weaknesses of the five tribes
-- problems in machine learning (#1 overfitting; #2 high dimensionality)
-- his layman definitions of various algorithms

Using _The Master Algorithm_ like a textbook.

https://brohrer.github.io/data_science_other_stuff.html:
"Machine learning is the attention hog of data science, but there are other important aspects:
data quality (cleaning), visualization, feature engineering, and operationalization (using models in practice)."

Possible overarching structures:

As I did research for this post, I realized that there are many really nice, accessible [explainers](https://brohrer.github.io/blog.html) [of]() [machine learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/machine-learning-algorithm-choice) out there. Duh. So ultimately, writing this has been more of a learning exercise for me.

I'll be linking back to source materials as much as possible - maybe the small thing I can contribute is (another) collection of useful links with some perspective.

Misc:
- _Master Algorithm_ introduced me to Geoffrey Hinton (U Toronto -> Google) as a deep learning expert, and now I feel like I see his name everywhere (http://jmlr.org/papers/volume15/srivastava14a/srivastava14a.pdf). I even recently (9/1) realized he was featured in an article I read before this book (https://www.wired.com/story/inside-microsofts-ai-comeback/).
