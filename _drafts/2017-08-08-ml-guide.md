TODO: A Beginner's Guide to Machine Learning, 5 Questions of Data Science, create that flow chart (mermaid)?, holehouse/ng notes, reinforcement learning section, active learning (+LUIS)...

I think I'm trying to run PCA on the field of machine learning... what are the principal components of ML? How can I reduce and differentiate all the jargon? By the 5 qs? By the 5 tribes?

Additionally, what's ML relationship to AI and data science? Now that I've confirmed deep learning is a subset of ML

    - "There's no fixed definition of these things"
    - Data science: "traditional statistical techniques, and then using human intuition to make predictions"
    - Machine learning: "using data to make predictions"
        - Predictive analytics/business intelligence: "can be a subset of the machine learning; a problem domain with the implication of a direct connection to increased revenue or decreased cost or something like this"
    - Artificial intelligence: "using very advanced machine learning techniques to mimic human behavior"
    - "bigger data; smarter algorithms; and increased processing via gpus, on demand in the cloud"

https://brohrer.github.io/data_science_other_stuff.html:
"Machine learning is the attention hog of data science, but there are other important aspects:
data quality (cleaning), visualization, feature engineering, and operationalization (using models in practice)."

Possible overarching structures:

Active learning:
- http://videolectures.net/icml09_dasgupta_langford_actl/
    - "Active learning is defined by contrast to the passive model of supervised learning where all the labels for learning are obtained without reference to the learning algorithm, while in active learning the learner interactively chooses which data points to label. The hope of active learning is that interaction can substantially reduce the number of labels required, making solving problems via machine learning more practical."
    - (8:07) Typical heuristics for active learning: Start with a pool of unlabeled data; pick a few points at random and get their labels; Repeat: Fit a classifier to the labels seen so far, Query the unlabeled point that is closest to the boundary (or most uncertain, or most likely to decrease overall certainty)


As I did research for this post, I realized that there are many really nice, accessible [explainers](https://brohrer.github.io/blog.html) [of](http://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/08/machine-learning-algorithms-concise-technical-overview-part-1.html) [machine](http://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/05/machine-learning-key-terms-explained.html) [learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/machine-learning-algorithm-choice) out there. Duh. So ultimately, writing this has been more of a learning exercise for me.

I'll be linking back to source materials as much as possible - maybe the small thing I can contribute is (another) collection of useful links with some perspective.

Using _The Master Algorithm_ like a textbook.

- _Master Algorithm_ introduced me to Geoffrey Hinton (U Toronto -> Google) as a deep learning expert, and now I feel like I see his name everywhere (http://jmlr.org/papers/volume15/srivastava14a/srivastava14a.pdf). I even recently (9/1) realized he was featured in an article I read before this book (https://www.wired.com/story/inside-microsofts-ai-comeback/).

Definitions:
- Genetic programs: survival of the fittest programs; John Koza's Genetic Programming
    - crossover: randomly swapping two subtrees in a program tree
    - fitness: measure of the distance between a program's output and the correct one on the training data
