As a scholar, I will be writing a blog post every Friday this summer about my weekly learnings and struggles. My [last post](/career/2018/06/03/project-ideation) described my search for a program goal:

> I will attempt to generate _topical, structured, and specific_ new writing ("reviews") about songs, based on a set of characteristics about the song and knowledge of past human music writing.

Like much about this summer, this is a goal post that may shift as I learn. Here is how my first week went.

## Part I. Where did all the data come from?

As a HypeM paid supporter, I requested access to their developer API. With that, I retrieved about 10K unique songs from the site's weekly popular charts, over the last 5 years.

## Part II. Generating terrible music reviews with n-grams

## Part III. My summer curriculum

## Part IV. Why I chose PyTorch (over TensorFlow)
